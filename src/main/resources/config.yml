# This variable contains the categories that will be displayed in the categories UI
# the first indented hyphen signifies a row, the second indented hyphen is a column within that row. 
# The number pair is the category id to link to and the head index in that category to use as category image
# Category id 0 means that no category will be displayed there
# The default category UI will look like this:
#
#   +--------------+-----------+---------+-------------+-----------+-----------+----------------+-------+------+
#   |     food     | alphabet  | blocks  |  interior   |characters |   mobs    |      misc      |pokemon|color |
#   +--------------+-----------+---------+-------------+-----------+-----------+----------------+-------+------+
#   |mh-food-drinks|mh-alphabet|mh-blocks|mh-decoration| mh-humans |mh-animals |mh-miscellaneous| Games |      | 
#   +--------------+-----------+---------+-------------+-----------+-----------+----------------+-------+------+
#   |              |           |         |   devices   |mh-humanoid|mh-monsters|                |       |      | 
#   +--------------+-----------+---------+-------------+-----------+-----------+----------------+-------+------+
# 
# You can just as easily add custom categories in here. Also note that you don't have
# to add all categories in this overview. The categories that are not in the overview
# are still accessible through the '/headsinv cat <categoryName>' command
# the amount of rows can vary, but the amount of columns always needs to be 9
